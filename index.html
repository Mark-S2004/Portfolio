        <h2>Data Analyst</h2>

        <p>Hi! I am Mark, a computer engineering student 👨‍💻, self-taught freelance data analyst &#x1F4BB and tennis player &#x1F3BE. Creating visualization dashboards of statistics that I extracted is my thing and I love to see useful information and insights emerge from raw data. I started my learning journey in high school and I secured my first freelancing gig when I was 17.</p>

            <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image">
            <p>The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.</p>

            <h3>Investigate Medical No-show appointments dataset</h3>
            <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image">
            <p>This dataset contains data of medical appointments in Brazil. The main problem is how to determine whether the patient will attend the appointment. My data analysis identifies why patients tend not to attend and factors that increase the chances of not attending. Moreover, it answers many questions about marketing and medicine.</p>
